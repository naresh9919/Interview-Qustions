DevOps Interview Questions
1. What is Version control?
Ans. It is a system that records changes to a file or set of files over time so that you can recall specific versions later.
Q2. What are containers?
Ans. Containers are a form of lightweight virtualization, heavier than ‘chroot’ but lighter than ‘hypervisors’. They provide isolation among processes while using the same kernel as the host machine, and ‘cgroups’ functionality within the kernel.
Q3. What is Continuous Delivery?
Ans. It is the practice of delivering the software for testing as soon as it is built by CI (Continuous Integration) servers.
Q4. What are the uses of Version control?
Ans. Below are some of the common uses of version control:

•	Revert the entire project back to a previous state.
•	Compare changes over time.
•	See who last modified something that might be causing a problem.
•	Who introduced an issue and when.
Q5. What are the core operations of DevOps in terms of development and Infrastructure?
Ans. The core operations of DevOps are application development, code developing, code coverage, unit testing, packaging, deployment with infrastructure, provisioning, configuration, orchestration, and deployment.
Q6. Can one consider DevOps as an Agile methodology?

Q8. What is Git?
Ans. Git is a Distributed Version Control system (DVCS). It can track changes to a file and allows you to revert back to any particular change.
Q9. In Git how do you revert a commit that has already been pushed and made public?
Ans. It can be done in two ways:
•	By removing or fixing the bad file in a new commit and pushing it to the remote repository. Once the necessary changes to the file have been made, commit it to the remote repository. Use: git commit -m “commit message”
•	By creating a new commit that undoes all changes that were made in the bad commit. To do this, use command: git revert <name of bad commit>
Q10. What is Git bisect?
